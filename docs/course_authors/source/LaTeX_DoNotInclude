Import Content from LaTeX
*************************

If LaTeX is enabled for your course, you can create an HTML component from imported LaTeX code.

Studio uses a third-party LaTeX processor to convert LaTeX code to XML. The LaTeX processor must be up and running.

1. When creating the new HTML component, select **E-text Written in LaTeX**.

   The new HTML component opens, with an **upload** link:
   
   .. image:: Images/latex_upload.png
     :width: 800   

2. To upload a LaTeX file from your computer, click **upload**.

   You are prompted to select a file.  The file loads in the LaTeX editor.
   
3. In the LaTeX editor, click **Save & Compile to edX XML**.   

   The LaTeX content is added to the HTML component. For example:
   
   .. image:: Images/Latex_component.png
     :width: 800


4. Verify that your newly created component looks the way you want it to. 

You can edit the HTML component with LaTeX as you can any other component. 
In the editor, you can launch the LaTeX source compiler.
